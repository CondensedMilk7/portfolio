    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Pridon and I am from Georgia. I have formal education in
      psychology and my interests have compelled me to pursue psychoanalysis. I
      document my explorations at
      <a href="https://primordialsoup.info" target="_blank"
        >primordialsoup.info</a
      >. Alongside this intellectual inquiry, I make living with web
      development. I'm always eager to learn different technologies, solve
      engaging problems and create interesting projects. "Learning" is the best
      term I can use to describe what I do in the most general sense.
